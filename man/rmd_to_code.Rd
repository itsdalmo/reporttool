\title{Convert .Rmd to .R}
\usage{
rmd_to_code(rmd, encoding = "UTF-8", write = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{rmd}{Path to a rmarkdown file.}

\item{encoding}{The encoding of both the input .Rmd file and the output.}
}

}
\description{
This function converts a \code{.Rmd} to a \code{.R} file (similar to \code{knitr::purl})
by replacing chunk delimiters and putting \code{eval} chunk options inside \code{if}
statements. Also comments out (\code{##+}) content that is not inside chunks,
and inserts a chunk number and line to distinguish chunks.
}
\note{
\code{UTF-8} is the recommended encoding for scripts and .Rmd files.
}
\examples{
rmd_to_script("Example report.Rmd", encoding = "latin1")
