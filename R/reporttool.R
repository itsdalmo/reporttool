#' reporttool: From raw data to batch reports
#'
#' This is a package created to make working with and creating
#' reports from survey data easier. The main goal is to provide
#' a framework for turning raw data into batch reports in an efficient manner.
#' 
#' This is achieved by providing:
#'
#' \itemize{
#' \item A predefined data structure, which facilitates most reporting jobs.
#' \item An intuitive pipeline for achieving the necessary structure.
#' \item Alternative i/o functions that make R work more seamlessly with every-day 
#' office tools.
#' \item Choice functions that make common operations less verbose.
#' \item Read-to-go templates for the supported formats (currently just PDF).
